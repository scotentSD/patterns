## Key principles ##
- **All Scottish Business Support can be found online at a single site**
- There are **Assisted Digital** options for those who can't or do not want to use the website

## Pattern
- The website should have listings of all Scottish Business services.
- It should have enough information to allow customers to make informed decisions about which services are for them.
- It should be optimised so that you find it first when looking for any Scottish Business Support that is delivered by the Public Sector. 

## Anti Pattern
- Websites that actually deliver the services rank higher than the central Find Business Support website

## Supporting research
- 460 research interactions covering all aspects of this area from
   - Potential
   - Demand
   - Implementation of a project to deliver this
- Desk research on
   - Previous similar projects
   - Insights from other research

**The research summarises as:**
- I find it hard to find stuff
- I have to look at lots of different, and confusing, government websites to try and find stuff
- When I find stuff, it is worded quite confusingly
- I find it hard to choose which services are best for my Business
- I waste a lot of time looking
- I often waste time applying for the wrong thing
- I would like an easier way to "Shop" for public sector support
