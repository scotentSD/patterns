## Key principles ##
- **Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) do not have the staff that can be dedicated to a single function that larger companies may have**
- This makes the need for effficiency, clarity and eqse of use when we are dlivering them services


## Pattern
- They are very time poor.
- The smaller they are, the more time poor they get
- Smaller businesses tend to have individuals performimg multiple roles
- They trust and rely on recomendations from peer groups
- Once they have a relationship with an Account Manager from a public sector agency, they tend to go to them first with questions, even if it is not their area of expertise
- Reciprocity is an important concept to keep in mind. Lack of time makes them prioritise activities that can benefit their business.
- Public sector jargon and service names is very confusing to most businesses

## Anti Pattern
- Once SME's work with us for a while, they start to adopt our language in order to "manage us". This can give an unrealistic view of how suitable our language and naming is.
